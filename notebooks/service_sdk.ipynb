    "# Using the service SDK\n",
    "\n",
    "The Service SDK provides an easy way to interact [Managed Services](https://docs.planqk.de/services/managed/introduction.html) on the Kipu Quantum Hub.\n",
    "Managed Services enable you to run your quantum code on-demand without needing to manage your own infrastructure, provision servers, or upgrade hardware.\n",
    "You can either run your own previously deployed services or run services from the [Marketplace](https://hub.kipu-quantum.com/marketplace/services).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find a detailed reference of the Service SDK in the [official documentation](https://docs.planqk.de/sdk-reference-service.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will demonstrate how to use the Service SDK to interact with a Service. For this example, we will use the \"Illay Base Quantum Optimizer\" service from the Marketplace.\n",
    "Later you can replace it with your own services.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by installing the Service SDK if you haven't done so already."
